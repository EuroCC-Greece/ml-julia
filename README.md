# ml-julia
Machine Learning algorithms for structured datasets with the Julia Language

## What is this tutorial about

In this codelab you will go through the following steps

1. Set up the Julia envrionment,
2. Run a set of simple exaples on creating matrices, plotting charts, and executing simple for-loops with CUDA. 
3. Go through introductory examples on machine learning (Regression and Descision Trees)

## How to start the tutorial

Just tap on the [colab file](../main/Machine_Learning_for_Structured_Datasets_with_MITâ€™s_Julia_Language.ipynb). You can either download it or tap the "Open in Colab" button at the top.
