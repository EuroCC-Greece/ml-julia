# ml-julia
Machine Learning algorithms for structured datasets with the Julia Language

In this codelab you will go through the following steps

1. Set up the Julia envrionment,
2. Run a set of simple exaples on creating matrices, plotting charts, and executing simple for-loops with CUDA. 
3. Go through introductory examples on machine learning (Regression and Descision Trees)
