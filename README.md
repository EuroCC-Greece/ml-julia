# ml-julia
Machine Learning algorithms for structured datasets with the Julia Language

## What is this tutorial about

In this codelab you will go through the following steps

1. Set up the Julia envrionment,
2. Run a set of simple exaples on creating matrices, plotting charts, and executing simple for-loops with CUDA. 
3. Go through introductory examples on machine learning (Regression and Descision Trees)

## How to start the tutorial

Just tap on the [codelab file](../blob/master/Machine_Learning_for_Structured_Datasets_with_MIT’s_Julia_Language.ipynb).
